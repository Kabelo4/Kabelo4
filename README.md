# Hi, I'm Kabelo

I'm a Machine Learning Engineer at Mintek with a Master's degree in Data Science (cum laude) from Stellenbosch University. My work focuses on applying machine learning to real-world industrial challenges.



## Research & Projects

- **Credit Risk Modeling**: Collaborated with Investec to develop a machine learning-based credit risk model aligned with Basel regulatory standards.
- **Industrial Applications**: Implemented anomaly detection systems for fault detection in flotation tanks and optimized industrial furnace operations using advanced data analytics (digital twins).
- **Interpretable Machine Learning**: Developing interpretable machine learning models for regulated environments, emphasizing transparency and ethical AI practices.
- **LLMs & RAG**: Exploring large language models and retrieval-augmented generation to enhance chatbot capabilities and knowledge management systems.



## Skills & Tools

- **Languages**: Python, R
- **Techniques**: Machine Learning, Signal Processing, Anomaly Detection, Interpretable ML, Deep Learning (Computer Vision, LLMs)
- **Tools**: scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras, pandas, NumPy, PyTorch, PySpark, SQL, Docker



## Interests

Iâ€™m passionate about ethical AI, emphasizing transparency and interpretability to build trust and acceptanceâ€”especially when using LLMs and AI in highly regulated industries. Iâ€™m also focused on applying AI in finance to improve financial models, and in industrial settings to enhance safety, increase throughput, reduce energy consumption and pollution, and support effective deployment.
